## CSV files: a common way to store data

CSV stands for "comma separated values" and is a commonly used file type for storing data.

Open the file "penguins.csv" from the files pane (lower right) to see what a .csv file looks like:

Each row of the file is an "observation" or "case", and consists of one or more variables whose *values* are *separated* by *commas* (hey, look at that). The first row contains the names of the variables contained in the file.

## Palmer Penguins Data

We're going to start by working with a data set with data on 333 penguins collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/), and the data were prepared by [Dr. Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins).

## Reading Data Into R

We can **read** data into R using a function called `read.csv()`. The first argument to `read.csv()` is the name of a .csv file (here, `penguins.csv`), in quotes. We then store the results of `read.csv()` as an object called `penguins`.

```{r readData}

penguins <- read.csv("penguins.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

```

Run the `tryIt6` chunk in your notes to read in the penguins data file.

## Peeking at the Data

Let's see what's in the data. We can peek at the first few (6, specifically) rows of the data using the `head()` function:

\tiny

```{r headPenguins}

head(penguins)

```

## Peeking at the Data

We read that line of code as "*head* of *penguins*". Remember that `penguins` is what we named our data set. We can see that `penguins` contains a number of *variables*, like `species`, `island`, and more.

Run the `tryIt7` chunk in your notes to peek at the first 6 rows of the penguins data file.

## Data

| Variable name    | Description                                                                                               |
|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| `species`        | Penguin species (AdÃ©lie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo)                                                           |
| `island`         | Island in Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica, on which the penguin was observed (Biscoe, Dream, or Torgersen) |
| `bill_length_mm` | A number denoting bill length (in millimeters)                                                            |
| `bill_depth_mm`  | A number denoting bill depth (in millimeters)                                                             |

## Data Continued

| Variable name       | Description                                             |
|:-------------------------------------|:--------------------------------|
| `flipper_length_mm` | A whole number denoting flipper length (in millimeters) |
| `body_mass_g`       | A whole number denoting penguin body mass (in grams)    |
| `sex`               | Penguin sex (female, male)                              |
| `year`              | Study year (2007, 2008, 2009)                           |

## Another Way

We can also peek at the data using a function called `str()` (pronounced "stir", short for "structure"):

\tiny
```{r strPenguins}

str(penguins)

```

\normalsize
Run the `tryIt8` chunk in your notes examine the structure of the penguins data file.
