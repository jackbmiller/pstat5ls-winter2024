# Instructions

- Complete the following exercises designed to help get you up and running in R and RStudio.
- Use the slides for help, and feel free to ask your lab instructor with questions.

# Lab Assignment

## Question 1
We're going to start by playing a bit with R Markdown. Read carefully through the text below and apply formatting to it as follows:

1. Make the text below that says "Tips and Tricks for R Markdown" bold.
2. Make the text below that says "Knit and knit often" italic.
3. Make the text below that says "Make sure your chunk syntax is correct" italic.
4. Make the text below that says "Be persistent!" bold.


**Tips and Tricks for R Markdown**

1. *Knit and knit often.* You'll be turning in the knitted HTML document to Canvas for grading, and it's important that you know what it looks like!
2. *Make sure your chunk syntax is correct.* You should only have one set of opening and closing backticks (```) per chunk!
3. **Be persistent!** Learning this system takes time, and it's okay if you don't get it right away. Just keep trying, and don't be afraid to ask for help!


## Question 2

Use R as a calculator to compute 

$$\frac{27}{2 + 3^2}$$

Assign this value the name `x` and have R print the value.

```{r question2, error = T}
# students must use the <- operator for full credit
x <- 27 / (2+3^2)
x

```


## Question 3

Use R as a calculator to compute 

$$\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} \times 0.257$$

Assign this value the name `y` and have R print the value.

```{r question3, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).
# students must use the <- operator for full credit
y <- (1/3) + (1/5)*0.257
y

```


## Question 4

Use R as a calculator to compute 

$$92^3 - 734$$

Assign this value the name `z` and have R print the value.

```{r question4, error = T}
# students must use the <- operator for full credit
z <- 92^3 - 734
z

```
