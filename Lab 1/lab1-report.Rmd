# Instructions

-   Complete the following exercises designed to help get you up and running in R and RStudio.
-   Use the slides for help, and feel free to ask your TA with questions.

**Collaborators:** If applicable, replace this text with the names of anyone you collaborated with on this project.

# Lab Assignment

## Question 1

We're going to start by playing a bit with R Markdown. Read carefully through the text below and apply formatting to it as follows:

1.  Make the text below that says "Tips and Tricks for R Markdown" bold.
2.  Make the text below that says "Knit and knit often" italic.
3.  Make the text below that says "Make sure your chunk syntax is correct" italic.
4.  Make the text below that says "Be persistent!" bold.

Tips and Tricks for R Markdown

1.  Knit and knit often. You'll be turning in the knitted PDF document to Gradescope for grading, and it's important that you know what it looks like!
2.  Make sure your chunk syntax is correct. You should only have one set of opening and closing backticks (\`\`\`) per chunk!
3.  Be persistent! Learning this system takes time, and it's okay if you don't get it right away. Just keep trying, and don't be afraid to ask for help!

## Question 2

Use R as a calculator to compute 

$$\frac{27}{2 + 3^2}$$

Assign this value the name `x` and have R print the value.

```{r question2, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).






```


## Question 3

Use R as a calculator to compute 

$$\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} \times 0.257$$

Assign this value the name `y` and have R print the value.

```{r question3, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).






```


## Question 4

Use R as a calculator to compute 

$$92^3 - 734$$

Assign this value the name `z` and have R print the value.

```{r question4, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

Give yourself a high five - you just wrote code!

### Submission instructions

```{=html}
<!-- This is a comment and will not show up in your document. Note that the
numbering here is all 1's. This will automatically be converted to 1, 2, etc.
when you knit the document; writing all 1's makes it so you don't have to
constantly update the numbering when you move things around in editing! -->
```
1.  In the Files pane, check the box next to your `lab1report.pdf`: </br>
