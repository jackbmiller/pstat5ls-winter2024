# Lab Code

Use the chunks below to try out any code that you'd like. We have loaded the `penguins` data set for you in the first chunk, so you can try things out with this data.

```{r loadPenguins, error = T}
penguins <- read.csv("penguins.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

```{r tryIt1, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to create a histogram of the sampled penguin flipper lengths. 
hist(penguins$flipper_length_mm,
     main = "Histogram of Flipper Length",
     xlab = "Flipper length (mm)",
     col = "#09847A")
```

```{r tryIt2, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to find the 90% confidence interval for the mean flipper length of all penguins in Palmer Archipelago
# Note that you don't need to use the `alternative` argument to find a confidence interval. If you would like to include 
t.test(penguins$flipper_length_mm, 
       conf.level = 0.9)
```

```{r tryIt2b, error = T}
# Note that you didn't need to use the `alternative` argument to find a confidence interval. If you would like to include that argument, be sure to use "two.sided" 
# Run this code chunk to get the confidence interval again with the `alternative` argument added in
t.test(penguins$flipper_length_mm, 
       alternative = "two.sided",
       conf.level = 0.9)
```

```{r tryIt3, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to run the hypothesis test for whether the mean flipper length of all penguins is greater than 199 mm
t.test(penguins$flipper_length_mm, 
       mu = 199, 
       alternative = "greater")
```

# Code Cheat Sheet

## `pt(q, df, lower.tail = TRUE)`

- `q` is the x-axis value you want to find an area related to
- `df` is the degrees of freedom of the $t$ distribution
- `lower.tail` determines whether `pt()` finds the area to the left or right of `q`. If `lower.tail = TRUE` (the default), it shades to the left. If `lower.tail = FALSE`, it shades to the right.
  
## `qt(q, df, lower.tail = TRUE)`

- `p` is the probability or area under the curve you want to find an x-axis value for
- `df` is the degrees of freedom of the $t$ distribution
- `lower.tail` determines whether `pt()` finds the area to the left or right of `q`. If `lower.tail = TRUE` (the default), it shades to the left. If `lower.tail = FALSE`, it shades to the right.
  
## `plot_t()`

- `df` refers to the degrees of freedom of the distribution to plot. You must provide this value.
- `shadeValues` is a vector of up to 2 numbers that define the region you want to shade
- `direction` can be one of `less`, `greater`, `beyond`, or `between`, and controls the direction of shading between `shadeValues`. Must be `less` or `greater` if `shadeValues` has only one element; `beyond` or `between` if two
- `col.shade` controls the color of the shaded region, defaults to `"cornflowerblue"`
- `...` lets you specify other graphical parameters to control the appearance of the normal curve (e.g., `lwd`, `lty`, `col`, etc.)

## `t.test(x, alternative, mu, conf.level)`
- `x` is a vector of data values
- `alternative` specifies the direction of the alternative hypothesis; must be one of "two.sided", "less", or "greater"
- `mu` indicates the true value of the mean (under the null hypothesis); defaults to 0
- `conf.level` is the confidence level to be used in constructing a confidence interval; must be between 0 and 1, defaults to 0.95

## Important plotting arguments

### `main = "Title of Your Graph in Double Quotes"`

- graph title that must be inside a set of double quotes

### `xlab = "x-axis Label of Your Graph in Double Quotes"`

- the x- (horizontal) axis label that must be inside a set of double quotes

### `ylab = "y-axis Label of Your Graph in Double Quotes"`

- the y- (vertical) axis label that must be inside a set of double quotes

# Reminder about Submission to Gradescope

At the top of the document, make sure you've changed the `author` field to your name (in quotes!) and the `date` field to today's date. 

When you've finished the lab, click the **Knit** button one last time.<br />

![Click the "Knit" button at the top of the editor pane"](assets/images/knit-button.png)

Give yourself a high five - you just wrote code! 

### Submission instructions
<!-- This is a comment and will not show up in your document. Note that the
numbering here is all 1's. This will automatically be converted to 1, 2, etc.
when you knit the document; writing all 1's makes it so you don't have to
constantly update the numbering when you move things around in editing! -->
