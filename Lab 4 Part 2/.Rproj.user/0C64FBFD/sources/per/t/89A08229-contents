# Introduction

Higher Ed Dive reported that 43% of students applying for college included their SAT and/or ACT score in the 2022-2023 application year.  

In a survey of high school students in a large metropolitan area, 74 out of 200 students surveyed reported including their SAT and/or ACT score in the 2022-2023 application year. **Is there evidence to suggest that the proportion of high school students in this large metropolitan area who included their SAT and/or ACT score in their college application is different from the national rate of 43%?** 

## Hypotheses
Write the null and alternative hypotheses below.
Please fill in your answer where it says **"Write your answer here"**.

$H_0$: $p = 0.43$

$H_A$: $p \neq 0.43$

where $p$ represents the proportion of high school students in this large metropolitan area who included their SAT and/or ACT score in their college application.

## Calculations
Assume the conditions for inference are satisfied. Use `prop_test()` to find the test statistic and p-value.

```{r codeBlock1, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to run the hypothesis test. 
prop_test(x = 74, n = 200, p = 0.43, alternative = "two.sided")

```

Please fill in your answer where it says **"Write your answer here"**.

The test statistic is **-1.7139**.
The p-value is **0.0865**.

## Decision and Conclusion
Please fill in your answer where it says **"Write your answer here"**.

Do you reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 10% significance level? Why?
**Since the p-value = 0.0865 is less than $\alpha$ = 0.10, we reject the null hypothesis**

Does your analysis suggest that the proportion of high school students in this large metropolitan area who included their SAT and/or ACT score in their college application is different from the national rate of 43%? 
**Yes**

## Confidence Interval
Calculate a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of high school students in this large metropolitan area who included their SAT and/or ACT score in their college application. 

```{r codeBlock2, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to calculate the 90% confidence interval. 
prop_test(x = 74, n = 200, p = 0.43, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.90)

```

We estimate with 90% confidence that the proportion of high school students in this large metropolitan area who included their SAT and/or ACT score in their college application is between **0.314 and 0.426**.
