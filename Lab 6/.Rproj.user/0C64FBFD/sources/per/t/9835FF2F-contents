# Introduction

The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations. We will be working with a cleaned up version of [this data set published by Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays?select=flights.csv). 

`delayed_flights.csv` reflects a random sample of only flights leaving from Detroit Metro Airport (DTW) from two airlines: American Airlines (`AA`) and Delta Airlines (`DL`). The airline info can be found in the `AIRLINE` variable. Then, the variable `AIRLINE_DELAY` was cleaned to reflect only actual delay times in minutes (i.e. non-zero, non-negative values for the variable).

## Research Question
Is there evidence to support that there is a difference in the average delay time in minutes (`AIRLINE_DELAY`) for American Airlines flights and Delta Airlines flights (`AIRLINE`) leaving Detroit Metro Airport? Your Lab 6 Report will answer this question.

The parameter of interest is $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ which represents the difference in the average flight delay time for American Airlines and the average flight delay for Delta Airlines, for flights that departed from Detroit Metro Airport.

## Question 1:
What hypotheses do you need to test to determine if there is a difference in the average delay time in minutes for American Airlines flights and Delta Airlines flights leaving Detroit Metro Airport?

$H_0$: $\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$

$H_A$: $\mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq 0$

## Question 2:
We need to check the conditions for inference before proceeding. 

For one of the conditions, you need to examine the data. First, you need to read in the data. 

```{r chunk1, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to read in the data
delays <- read.csv("delayed_flights.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

Then create histograms for the two samples:

```{r chunk2, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to create a histogram for the flight delays for American Airlines
hist(delays$AIRLINE_DELAY[delays$AIRLINE == "AA"],
     main = "Histogram of American Airlines Delays",
     xlab = "Flight Delay in Minutes")
```

```{r chunk3, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to create a histogram for the flight delays for Delta Airlines
hist(delays$AIRLINE_DELAY[delays$AIRLINE == "DL"],
     main = "Histogram of Delta Airlines Delays",
     xlab = "Flight Delay in Minutes")
```

Check the conditions below:

1. **Independence within each group:** since this is a random sample, we can assume that we have independence within each airline.
2. **Independence between each group:** Delta Airlines and American Airlines are two different airlines, and since we took a random sample from a list of flights, we can assume that we have independence between each airline.
3. **Normality:**

    - Looking at the histogram of sampled American Airlines flight delays, the histogram does show a right-skew. We will need to consider relaxing the condition, which is possible thanks to a large sample size.
    - Looking at the histogram of sampled Delta Airlines flight delays, the histogram does show a right-skew. We will need to consider relaxing the conditon, which is posisble thanks to a large sample size.

## Question 3:
Conduct the test of the hypotheses you stated above.

```{r chunk4, error = T}
# Run this chunk to get the hypothesis test 
t.test(AIRLINE_DELAY ~ AIRLINE, data = delays, mu = 0, alternative = "two.sided")
```

a. The value of the test statistic is **-1.7324**, and the *p*-value is **0.08587**.

b. Do you reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.10 significance level? Why?

**Since the *p*-value = 0.08587 is less than the significance level 0.10, we reject the null hypothesis.**

c. Write a conclusion in context.

**Our analysis suggests that there is a difference in the average delay time in minutes for American Airlines flights and Delta Airlines flights leaving Detroit Metro Airport.**

d. Would your decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis be the same at the 0.05 significance level? Why or why not?

**No--since the *p*-value is greater than 0.05, we would fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level.**

## Question 4:
Use R to calculate a 90% confidence interval for the difference in the average delay time in minutes (`AIRLINE_DELAY`) for American Airlines flights and Delta Airlines flights (`AIRLINE`) leaving Detroit Metro Airport.

```{r chunk5, error = T}
t.test(AIRLINE_DELAY ~ AIRLINE, data = delays, conf.level = 0.9)
```

Based on this 90% confidence interval, which airline would you recommend to your roommate, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, or no preference? Explain why. Be sure to include numerical evidence.

**Based on the 90% confidence interval of (-12.594, -0.276) minutes, I might consider recommending American Airlines over Delta, because it appears that on average, American Airlines may have shorter delay times. But, this choice does not reflect many factors, such as price of tickets, which arriving/departing airport, number of stops, etc.**
